Hi, I'm a researcher at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/">Samsung research</a>, Korea.
My primary research goal is to <b>develop robustly reasoning AI like humans</b> through structured and disentangled inference.

Iâ€™m especially interested in developing logical and consistent reasoning structures in NLP or multi-modal fields, especially injecting knowledge with graph or neuro-symbolic approaches.
Before working for Samsung, I worked at <a href="https://bi.snu.ac.kr/">BI Lab</a> and got my Master's degree at Seoul National University, 
advised by professor <a href="https://bi.snu.ac.kr/~btzhang/">Byoung-Tak Zhang</a>.

Additionally, if you have time please visit <b><a href="https://ahjeong.tistory.com">my AI tech blog</a></b> :D (In Korean) <br>
Thank you for visiting my homepage!
